## Introduction
This is partially a school project but mostly for me to learn about how computers work at the machine code level.
<br>
<br>
The repo is organised in to folders for each project or tutorial.
<br>
<br>
The examples will be shown in two languages. Python and x86-64 assembly. This will show the differences between how a computer operates at two different levels.

## Hello world
Although these tutorials should start from the simplest example first, it is tradition to print the phrase **Hello, world!** as the first thing when learning a new programming language.

### User
At the user level, all you will see is the phrase **Hello, world!** printed on your screen or terminal. Here is a screenshot of the output of a simple *Hello, world!* script in python:

### Python

This is how you can print out *Hello, world!* in python:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print "Hello, world"

```
What this does is as follows:
